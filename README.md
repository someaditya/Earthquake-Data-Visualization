# Earthquake Data Visualization

This independent project tries to visualize the earthquakes by utilizing the real time APIs provided by the United States Geological Survey. This project is created using Mike Bostock's JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers called D3. The project also makes use of Leaflet.js and Per Liedman's Leaflet Realtime.

## Requirements

- Leaflet (http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet-0.7.3/leaflet.js)
- Leaflet-Realtime (https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime)
- D3.js V4 (http://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js)

The United States Geological Survey is a scientific agency of the United States government. The scientists of the USGS study the landscape of the United States, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it.Earthquake Hazards Program. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/. shares nformation on earthquake activity, earthquake science, and earthquake hazard reduction with links to news reports, products and services, educational resources for teachers, glossary, and current U.S. earthquake activity map.

Here are the list of real time APIs used for this project :-

1.Past One Hour - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson  
2.Past One Day - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson  
3.Past One Week - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson  
4.Past One Month - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson
